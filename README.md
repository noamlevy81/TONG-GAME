# TONG-GAME


The game made by myself and Ziv Haltzband for school as first object oriented project.

Game instructions:

Tong game requires the player to move a “Board” using the keyboard, in order to hit a ball and “return” it to the other player, as in a tennis game. 
Note: Board means the line that is controlled by the player to hit the ball.
In our Pong game, once a player misses the ball a “copy” of his board will “drop” as in tetris game
to the “lowest” position on his side of the screen 
(for the player on the right => board will go to the right, for the player on the left => board will go to the left)
and the new position of the board will go “up” by one, making him one step closer to losing.
In case “dropped boards” complete a full line,
the entire line would disappear and the board would gain back five lines (go back five lines) 
note: if there are old boards in these lines they will be deleted.
Left player “Bomb” key is ‘s’ or ‘S’ key
Right player “Bomb” key is ‘k’ or ‘K’ key
Once pressed, the Ball turns into “becoming a Bomb”, 
and it changes its color to blue which indicates its threatening new state, 
then after 8 moves, the Ball becomes a “Bomb” and changes its color to red, which indicating that it is a Bomb.
